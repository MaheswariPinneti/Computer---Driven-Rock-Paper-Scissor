# Computer---Driven-Rock-Paper-Scissor
Rock Paper Scissors is a popular hand game played between two or more players. In this game, each player simultaneously throws one of three hand signals: Rock, Paper, or Scissors. The winning hand beats the losing hand as follows: Rock smashes Scissors, Paper covers Rock, and Scissors cut Paper.Using a computer, we can create a Rock Paper Scissors game that allows a user to play against the computer. The computer can generate a random choice (Rock, Paper, or Scissors) and the user can input their choice. The game can then determine the winner based on the game's rules.
